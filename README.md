# Green-Energy-Optimisation---PE

This project aims to optimise the use of renewable energy amongst a group of datacenters
by forwarding of the load/request to such a datacenter where there are higher chances of
renewable energy being used.

In present scenario, the load/requests are scheduled using randomized algorithms. In our
project we have created a scheduling algorithm taking the renewable energy generated at
a location as a factor, rather than randomly forwarding the request to any data center.
This project uses the solar irradiance prediction and datacenter load prediction, which
helps to forward a job to appropriate data center. In this way we can decrease the cost of
processing for every data center by optimising the amount of renewable energy used across
the group of datacenters, thereby decreasing the non-renewable energy consumption.
